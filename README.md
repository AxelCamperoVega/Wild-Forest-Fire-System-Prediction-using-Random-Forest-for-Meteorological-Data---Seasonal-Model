# Wild-Forest-Fire-System-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-for-Meteorological-Data---Seasonal-Model
This part of the project uses meteorological data from NASA POWER - DATA ACCESS VIEWER in order to get historical data of temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity to build a seasonal model of each one of these variables
